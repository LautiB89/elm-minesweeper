# Minesweeper

Learning Elm by coding a game I really like.

You can play it [here](https://lautib89.github.io/elm-minesweeper/).

## To Do

- If first revealed tile is a bomb, generate positions again avoiding the chosen one
- Generate exactly the number of bombs I want, and not any less. Currently it can generate less because of generating repeated positions
- Prettier style
