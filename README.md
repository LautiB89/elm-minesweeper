# Minesweeper

Learning Elm by coding a game I really like.

## To Do

- Choose Difficulty
- Deploy to Github pages
- If first revealed tile is a bomb, generate positions again avoiding the chosen one
- Generate exactly the number of bombs I want, and not any less. Currently it can generate less because of generating repeated positions
- Prettier style
